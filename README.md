# Healthcare-Analytics-Project

**Goals:**
The goal of this healthcare analytics project is to predict patient readmission using a machine learning model. Predicting whether a patient is likely to be readmitted to the hospital after an initial admission can be valuable for healthcare providers in optimizing patient care and resource allocation.

**Explanation:**
The project uses a dataset containing various patient attributes, such as age, number of lab procedures, number of medications, time spent in the hospital, and other relevant features. The target variable is whether a patient is readmitted or not. A RandomForestClassifier is employed to build a predictive model.

**Instructions for Running the Code:**
Clone the Repository:

**Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:**
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-analytics-project.git
**Install Dependencies:**

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, install the required libraries by running:
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
**Download the Dataset:**

**Obtain the healthcare dataset (e.g., 'healthcare_data.csv') and place it in the project directory.
Run the Code:**

**Navigate to the project directory and run the Python script:**
bash
Copy code
cd healthcare-analytics-project
python healthcare_analytics.py
**Review Results:**

The script will train the model, evaluate its performance, and display accuracy metrics. Additionally, the classification report provides detailed information on precision, recall, and F1-score.
**(Optional) Save Model:**

If desired, uncomment the code for saving the trained model using joblib.
